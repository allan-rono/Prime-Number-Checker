# What are prime numbers?
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and the number itself. That is, it can only be divided equally by 1 and itself.

- Natural numbers are positive integers such as 1, 5, 201, 229999 etc. The number 0, fractions, decimals, and negative numbers are not natural numbers.

- The number 5 is a prime number because its ONLY factors are 1 and 5. There is no other way to ‘create’ the number 5.

- The number 4 is not a prime number because 2 x 2 also gives us 4.

- The number 20 is not a prime number because 5 x 4 also gives us 20, as well as 2 x 10.
